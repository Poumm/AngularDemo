### AngularDemo

A small demonstration of capabilities enabled with AngularJS, HTML5 and CSS3, through the power of Twitter-Bootstrap, 
performing "Responsive Display" on standard browser and on Smart devices.

Size and display are auto-adaptive to user device.

> _Note:_
> A new maven process had just been addeed to perform WADL rest description file generation with @com.sun.jersey.contribs:maven-wadl-plugin@.
> To perform WADL generation, just run  the following command:

    mvn compile com.sun.jersey.contribs:maven-wadl-plugin:generate




MVC is back on Web-browser with angularJS to keep control on what happened on the client side.
